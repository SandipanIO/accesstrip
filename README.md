# AccessTrip

AccessTrip is a personalized travel planner that curates accessible and culturally aligned itineraries based on a user's unique tastes. The goal is to make travel more inclusive, especially for those with specific accessibility needs, while tailoring every suggestion to what the user genuinely enjoys, whether thatâ€™s a love for jazz, vegan food, or art festivals.
